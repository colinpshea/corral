#' Calculate population- and individual-level kinship (and gene diversity)
#'
#' @description This function calculates population- and individual-level mean kinship and gene diversity (1 - kinship) across all individuals and loci. These calculations exclude invariant loci and are based on all possible among-locus pairwise comparisons at each of `N` loci. Within-individual comparisons (i.e., comparisons of individuals with themselves) are also excluded from these calculations. Optionally, individual-level kinship can be calculated for a subset of individuals using the `targetN` argument.
#' @param dataset A data frame with `Coral_ID` column as unique identifier (rows) and loci as columns; this is a data frame resulting from the  `convertBasePairstoCodes()` function.
#' @param subset Do you want to subset the data and calculate kinship for the `targetN` least related colonies in the data set? The default value is FALSE, in which case `targetN` is ignored and defaults to NULL. If `subset = TRUE` then you MUST enter a value for `targetN`; otherwise the function will quit and print an error message.
#' @param targetN The desired number of individuals over which population-average kinship and gene diversity are calculated. This is ignored if left as `NULL` or if its value is greater than or equal to `nrow(dataset)` i.e., the number of individuals in a data set. If this value is < `nrow(dataset)`, then kinship is recalculated repeatedly, removing the individual with the highest average kinship, one-by-one, until `targetN` individuals with the lowest average kinship remain.
#' @returns This function returns three objects, `PopAvgMKGD`, `MK_init`, and `MK_final`. `PopAvgMKGD` contains the population-level average kinship and gene diversity; `MK_init` contains average kinship for each individual in dataset (i.e., `now(dataset)` individuals), and `MK_final` contains average kinship for the `targetN` individuals with the lowest average kinship.
